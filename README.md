# NURBS UI

A simple UI for understanding Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) written in **Python**.

## User Interface

The user interface is divided in two parts.

## NURBS Definition

The following properties of the curve can be altered:

- Control Points
- Weights
- Degree
- Number os segments interpolated(for visual smoothness)
- Curve domain (2D o 3D)

## Examples

A sequence os examples showing the incredible versatility that can be achieved using NURBS.

## Requirements

The only requirement is the Numpy Library.

- Numpy=>1.1

## How to Run

Just execute the `main.py` script.

## Gallery

Few screenshots of the program.
