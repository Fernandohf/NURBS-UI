## User Interface

The user interface is divided in two parts.

## NURBS Definition

The following properties of the curve can be altered:

- Control Points
- Weights
- Degree
- Number os segments interpolated(for visual smoothness)
- Curve domain (2D o 3D)

## Examples

A sequence os examples showing the incredible versatility that can be achieved using NURBS.

## Requirements

 Just execute the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Numpy>=1.1
- Matplotlib>=3.0
